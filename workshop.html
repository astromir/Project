                <p class="workspace_p1">Quantum computing uses specialized technology—including computer hardware and algorithms that take advantage
                 of quantum mechanics—to solve complex problems that classical computers or supercomputers can’t solve, or
                 can’t solve quickly enough.</p></li>

                <h3> History </h3>
                <div class="workspace_p2"> 
                    <h4>1981</h4> Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman, at Caltech, coins the term quantum computer. 
                    <h4>1985</h4> Physicist David Deutsch, at Oxford, maps out how a quantum computer would operate, a blueprint that underpins the nascent industry of today.
                    <h4>1994</h4> Mathematician Peter Shor, at Bell Labs, writes an algorithm that could tap a quantum computer’s power to break widely used forms of encryption. 
                    <h4>2004</h4> Barbara Terhal and David DiVincenzo, two physicists working at IBM, develop theoretical proofs showing that quantum computers can solve certain math puzzles faster than classical computers.
                    <h4>2014</h4> Google starts its new quantum hardware lab and hires the professor behind some of the best quantum computer hardware yet to lead the effort. 
                    <h4>2014</h4> Google hires the professor behind some of the best quantum computer hardware yet to lead its new quantum hardware lab.
                    <h4>2016</h4> IBM puts some of its prototype quantum processors on the internet for anyone to experiment with, saying programmers need to get ready to write quantum code. 
                    <h4>2019</h4> Google’s quantum computer beats a classical supercomputer at a commercially useless task based on Terhal and DiVincenzo’s 2004 proofs, in a feat many call “quantum advantage.”
                    <h4>2020</h4> The University of New South Wales in Australia offers the first undergraduate degree in quantum engineering to train a workforce for the budding industry.

                <h3> Jargon </h3>
                
                    <div class="workspace_p3">
                        <h4>What's a qubit?</h4> A device that uses quantum mechanical effects to represent 0s and 1s of digital data, similar to the bits in a conventional computer.
                        <h4>What are they made from?</h4> Qubits come in different designs. Some take the form of on circuits made of superconducting material. Others are devices that control individual atoms, individual charged atoms known as ions, or single photons.
                        <h4>How reliable are they?</h4> Qubits don’t hold on to information perfectly because of interactions with the environment. In state-of-the-art hardware, this results in a computing error around once in every 1,000 operations.
                        <h4>Is that a problem?</h4> The dream algorithms of the field require an error rate of about one in a billion operations. Researchers have developed codes to correct these errors, but they require a lot of computational power to implement. In the meantime, quantum computing experts are investigating how machines without error checking might still be useful.
                        <h4>What's a superposition?</h4> It's the trick that makes quantum computers tick, and makes qubits more powerful than ordinary bits. A superposition is a mathematical combination of both 0 and 1. Quantum algorithms can use a group of qubits in a superposition to shortcut through calculations.
                        <h4>What's quantum entanglement?</h4> A quantum effect so unintuitive that Einstein dubbed it “spooky action at a distance.” When two qubits in a superposition are entangled, certain operations on one have instant effects on the other, a process that helps quantum algorithms be more powerful than conventional ones.
                        <h4>What's quantum advantage?</h4> The term refers to a quantum computer capable of performing a task—useful or not—faster than a state-of-the-art supercomputer. Also sometimes known as “quantum supremacy” or “quantum computational advantage,” the term is a moving target as researchers continue to improve classical algorithms.
